# Boids Flocking Visualization
Welcome to the Boids Flocking Visualization repository! Experience the mesmerizing world of flocking behavior with our real-time simulation. Watch as boids dynamically flock, swarm, and move together in a naturalistic and emergent manner, creating stunning patterns and formations. With our customizable parameters, you have the power to tweak alignment, cohesion, and separation settings to observe how they influence the flocking behavior in real-time. Dive deep into the world of collective motion and explore the fascinating dynamics of group behavior.
